My chosen corpus is the novella of Brick, a 2005 film written and directed by Rian
Johnson (Knives Out, Star Wars: The Last Jedi). This movie is a film noir set in high
school that follows Brenden, a quiet high school student trying to solve the mystery
of why his ex was murdered. This corpus is the novella that Johnson wrote before
penning the screenplay, and therefore follows the plot of the movie very closely.
